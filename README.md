I strongly recommend that you download Anaconda on your laptop. It helps to set up the Python environment by managing libraries, dependencies, and environments for you. It comes with a lot of pre-installed third-party libraries, which can save you a lot of time. Anaconda Download: https://www.anaconda.com/ 

During installation, remember to check the 'add anaconda3 to my path environment variable' option under Advanced Installation Options.
